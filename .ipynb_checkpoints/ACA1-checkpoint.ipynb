    "    1) Low crime: I only kept colleges from DOE list located within cities with the lowest 25% of crime rates.\n",
    "    2) Diverse culture: I only kept colleges without a supermajority (over 2/3) of one racial group or gender. I also removed \n",
    "    all colleges with a special mission (ex. HBCUs)\n",
    "    3) City life: I only kept colleges in/near metropolitan areas or in micropolitan areas.\n",
    "    4) A quality education: I only kept colleges with the highest 15% of graduation rates.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Additionally, I removed all colleges location in Puerto Rico, Hawaii, or Alaska, as these are not part of the continental United States.\n",

    "After filtering the database, I came up with a list of 40 colleges that I recommend you look into.\n",

    "Below, you can see the list sorted by two additional criteria: tuition and proportion of students 25 years or older.\n",

    "Relatively Low Tuition and Relatively High Proportion of Students 25 and Older are potentially positive features of a college for you, as a student coming in the civilian workforce coming from military service.\n",
